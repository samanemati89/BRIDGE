# BRIDGE: Behavioral Risk Indicators Driving Gap Estimations  
### CAT12 → BrainAGE Pipeline & BAG Prediction from Behavioral Features

This repository documents the complete workflow used to estimate **brain age** using the **CAT12 / BrainAGE framework** and to evaluate whether **behavioral measures** can predict Brain Age Gap (BAG).  
It includes preprocessing steps, feature extraction, brain-age modeling, BAG computation, and machine-learning analyses.

# 1️⃣ MRI Preprocessing (CAT12)

 **SPM12 + CAT12** are used to preprocess T1-weighted MRI scans and this generates the tissue maps required for BrainAGE.

### **1.1 Required data structure**
Each subject folder must contain their raw T1w file:

{Subject_ID}/T1_{Subject_ID}.nii
Example: ABC1001/T1_ABC1001.nii
